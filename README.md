# TC_Converter - Solution for automating payments from travel agiencies

Intro:

Due to a lot of manual handling in every step and a lot of time spent following up this part of the accounting, I started on this project to simplify the processes. 

Aim for this project was to:

- Automate posting of payments for a certain partner
- Standardize posting in the accounting system
- Minimize risc for wrong posting
- Minimize risc of collections for already paid receivables
- Minimize needs and time associated with employee training
- Facilitate and minimize reconciliation time
- Minimize time for documentation by making transactions easily traceable


Approch:

1. Communication and collaboration with vendor to create files for their payments.  
2. Deside on format of files and design of content inside the files in collaboration with vendor
3. Create a secure exchange platform of the files with collaboration with vendor -> FTP Server
4. Communication and collaboration with internal IT-infrastructure to access the FTP-server and being able to access through a sFTP server
5. Escalating files for all properties
6. Creating solution to merge XML files into a CSV file that can be read and imported into the accounting system. Must be easy in use.
7. Creating a CSV-file containg good transaction details making them easily traceable and reconciliated in the accounting system
8. Distribute and communicating the solution to the accounting-department
9. Training, support and bugfixes
10. Handing over responsibility
